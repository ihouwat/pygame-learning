## Introduction
The goal is to create a simple, 2-D RPG Fighter styled game with pygame in order to teach various concepts and techniques. Note that since this is a tutorial, the code is all in one file to keep the learning process simple.

## Game Concept
We will be controlling a standard Player sprite with which we will interact with the world. There are multiple dungeons to select from, where enemies will generate and attack you. You gain experience and “mana” points from killing each enemy. Mana can be used to unleash special attacks such as a ranged fireball. Enemies may drop items at random such as hearts which restore health.
