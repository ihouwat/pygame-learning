# PyGame Tutorials
Each tutorial has a README.md file with notes and code snippets.

Folders:
* `000_game-loop`: the Game Loop and how to initialize and end a pygame program
* `001_drawing`: surfaces, displaying images
* `002_events`: simple event handling
* `003_car-game`: a small game where the player controls a car and avoids crashing into oncoming traffic
* `004_rpg`: a simple RPG game with a player, enemies, and a dungeon

I also keep a record of my chat session with Github Copilot [in this file](/tutorials/github-copilot-chat.json).
