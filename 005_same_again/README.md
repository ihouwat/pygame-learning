# Same Again!

## Introduction
**Same Again!** is a matching and language skills game for my kiddo. When she loves something, she'll keep asking for it, 'same again! same again!' :)

The goal is to teach kiddo to match an item against four options. The item to be matched is an image. As the game becomes more difficult, the item is a spoken word that represents the correct image. The language is selected when we first start the game, and is one of English, Arabic, Portuguese, or French.
